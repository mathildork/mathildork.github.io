                                                          <br>of dancers of lifeguards of accountants
                                                          <br>with their ticked-off pay rolling out the sky

                                                          <br>Is this the beginning of course not there is
                                                          <br>still so much for a handful to do in losing a finger
                                                          <br>before the work of a real society can begin

                                                          <br>of automation theories that discussed the waking
                                                          <br>labour of waking up and interpreting sunshine
                                                          <br>
                                                          <br>On my last partner's face the sky had called it quits
                                                          <br>the conditions were unfeasible and culminating in general
                                                          <br>strikes against my happiness and I'm not a scab
                                                          <br>
                                                          <br>But at my worst I am in love with cruising in straight times
                                                          <br>through the utopian suburbs of pragmatic gays who invested wisely
                                                          <br>in the right areas of legislation of their city of their poems
                                                          <br>
                                                          <br>And they have double beds so imagine beautiful
                                                          <br>exhausted me in the arms of someone who hated someone
                                                          <br>and just let me work out the theory of waking up here
